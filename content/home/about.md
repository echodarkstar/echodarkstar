I am a fourth year undergraduate student from Mumbai. My research interests include machine learning, and its applications in natural language processing and computer vision. I am especially interested in the use of representation learning as a way to understand semantic information underlying different modalities like text, speech and images.

I like to read and write fiction as well, when I am not doing research and development. I'll end this short introduction with some evocative words written by a better hand than mine.
